### **My Contributions**  
I developed the frontend using **React.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring a responsive and user-friendly interface. I implemented **user authentication** using JWT to enhance security and access control. On the backend, I designed and optimized **MongoDB schemas** for efficient data storage and built **RESTful APIs** in **Node.js & Express.js** to manage users, bookings, and travel packages. Additionally, I integrated the **Braintree payment gateway** for seamless transactions and deployed the application using **Docker and cloud services**, ensuring scalability and reliability.  

### **Environment Configuration**  
The application requires specific environment variables, including:  
- **MONGO_URL** – MongoDB connection string.  
- **JWT_SECRET** – Secret key for authentication.  
- **BRAINTREE_MERCHANT_ID, BRAINTREE_PUBLIC_KEY, BRAINTREE_PRIVATE_KEY** – Braintree payment gateway credentials.  
- **NODE_ENV_CUSTOM** – Environment mode (development/production).  
- **SERVER_URL** – Server hosting URL.
